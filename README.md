URL addresses for RStudio and Shiny environments
The Binder repository can be used to allow anyone to access an RStudio environment containing our code and data right in their web browser. It also allows hosting a Shiny app. For those purposes, we have to append a bit of text to the URL of our Binder repository, which we can find out at mybinder.org when we enter the URL of our original repository from GitHub or Figshare, etc.

For the RStudio environment, we must add the following at the end of the URL: ?urlpath=rstudio

Example: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jmea2/test_R_binder/master?urlpath=rstudio
